// In ext4, the file to logical block map has been replaced with an extent tree. Under the old scheme, allocating a
// contiguous run of 1,000 blocks requires an indirect block to map all 1,000 entries; with extents, the mapping is
// reduced to a single struct ext4_extent with ee_len = 1000. If flex_bg is enabled, it is possible to allocate very
// large files with a single extent, at a considerable reduction in metadata block use, and some improvement in disk
// efficiency. The inode must have the extents flag (0x80000) flag set for this feature to be in use.

// Extents are arranged as a tree. Each node of the tree begins with a struct ext4_extent_header. If the node is an
// interior node (eh.eh_depth > 0), the header is followed by eh.eh_entries instances of struct ext4_extent_idx; each of
// these index entries points to a block containing more nodes in the extent tree. If the node is a leaf node
// (eh.eh_depth == 0), then the header is followed by eh.eh_entries instances of struct ext4_extent; these instances
// point to the file's data blocks. The root node of the extent tree is stored in inode.i_block, which allows for the
// first four extents to be recorded without the use of extra metadata blocks.
